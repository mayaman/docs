# An Intro to AI

Runway is a platform that allows creators of all kinds to use machine learning. Runway provides you with a simple way to use the latest machine learning techniques and algorithms in an intuitive way. Here we aim to introduce some key concepts and touch upon the history of AI.

AI is a widely used term, but here we define it as being **systems that can simulate intelligent behavior in computers**. AI groups techniques inspired by natural intelligence. Currently AI systems undertake a specific task, but there is movement towards trying to build a machine that is as smart as a human, often referred to as **Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)**.

## History of AI

AI was originally born in the 1950's. Here, Alan Turing asked 'Can a Machine Imitate Human Intelligence?' in his paper [Computing and Machine Intelligence](http://cogprints.org/499/1/turing.html). Turing created the imitation game, where an interrogator would try to distinguish the human from the computer through asking a series of questions.

Turing's research and question, inspired a series of researchers in the 1950's and onwards. This lead to an AI boom between 1956-1973, where AI pioneers made predictions that did not come to fruit, leading to the AI winter in the 1980's. This boom period lead to the development of today's subfields of AI, including image and video processing, natural language processing and machine learning.

In recent years, we have seen a surge of popularity return to AI. This rise is due to: 1) improvements in infrastructures such as processing speed; 2) increased data collection 3) open source technologies which allows the sharing of scalable tech 4) sharing of new techniques and advances so the community learns from one another. With the culmination and dependency of these factors we have seen an unprecedented rate of development within AI.

Although we are far behind any form of **AGI**, today's AI systems are far reaching and here to stay. We experience AI when we talk to Siri, search on Google, make payments using a credit card, ride-share, park a car with assistance; there are endless numbers of examples of AI in use.

## Machine Learning

One ever-growing subfield and of AI is Machine Learning, which uses **statistical techniques to give computers the ability to learn or improve the performance of a given task without explicitly programming a sequence of instructions.** Runway is a platform that allows you to explore in an intuitive an easy way these machine learning capabilities.

Machine learning is broken into several broad categories: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Active Learning.

1) **Supervised Learning** is the task of learning the function that maps input to output.  Data is given to a machine as pairs of input-output. For example. The data can be labelled images which tell the machine what is in the image. The machine learns those labels, in order to determine whats in new, unseen images. This is seen in models that detect and recognise items within an image such as objects or faces.

2) **Unsupervised Learning** is the task of trying to find groups, or clusters within the data. The data only consists of input, rather than pairs. For example. Images can be organised by visual similarity, when a machine extracts image features such as color and stroke detection.

3) **Active Learning** (aka. Reinforcement learning) is software agents learning how they should act in a scenario, to maximize and accumulate a reward. For example. A machine learns to play board games, such as chess or go, through trial-and-error, where the machine is rewarded and punished as signals for both positive and negative behavior.

Within Runway, the models are predominantly from forms of Supervised Learning, as input is mapped to output.

## Automation vrs. Augmentation

A key debate within AI, is whether AI should Automate or Augment. **Automation** very much attempts to remove and reduce human processing and interaction. Forms of Automation are currently shown in the manufacturing processes, where linnes of products can be made with no human-interaction.  **Augmentation**, however, looks at ways to enhance our current processes, and augment our human intelligence. Instead, humans work with AI as a form of collaboration, where AI can assist in trivial matters.

**Runway** provides a set of tools to use machine learning. But Runway is here to augment your creative process and allow you to use machine learning within creativity. It is not a toolkit to replace nor automate creativity.
